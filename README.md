Introduction
I have chosen a data about various factors which were noted during admission to the university.
There are 8 features in total i.e., GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, SOP (Statement of
Purpose), LOR (Letter of Recommendation), CGPA, research and chance of admission (chance of
Admit). Total 400 entries/samples are included in this dataset. Chance of Admit is the
binary/categorical variable (has a continuous value between 0 and 1) which is the response variable
and helps in prediction of the admission. I have implemented following parts in this project
1. Data loading and importing libraries
2. Data visualization and correlation using Seaborn
3. Data splitting into test and train using sciklearn packages
4. Running Multiple Linear Regression model from pandas
